#  Security Incident Management System (ServiceNow Project)

##  Project Overview
This project is a customized **Security Incident Ticketing System** built using **ServiceNow**. It simulates how real-world organizations intake, triage, and manage security system issues like CCTV failures, access control problems, and alarms.

##  Problem Statement
Security teams often lack a centralized and structured way to log, track, and resolve physical security system issues. This leads to inefficiency and delayed response times.

## Solution
Using ServiceNow, I created a professional **ticket intake and workflow system** that:
- Captures critical site and system information at intake
- Automates assignments and escalations using Flow Designer
- Standardizes documentation for audits and site history

## Combine Features
- Customized Incident Form with:
  - Site Name
  - System Type (CCTV, Access Control, Alarm, etc.)
  - Contact Info
  - Priority
  - Attachments
- Workflow Automation via Flow Designer:
  - Assign tickets based on system type
  - Auto-prioritize based on inputs
  - Send notifications

## Tools Used
- **ServiceNow**
- **Flow Designer**
- Incident Table Customization
- GitHub for Documentation

##  Job Alignment
This project aligns with responsibilities like:
- Managing service ticket intake
- Supporting field engineering teams
- Improving operational efficiency through automation
- Maintaining system documentation

##  Lessons Learned
- Practical experience with form design and process automation
- Improved understanding of ITSM best practices
- Reinforced alignment between system design and real job expectations
